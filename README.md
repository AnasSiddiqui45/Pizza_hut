This project analyzes a pizza sales database using SQL to extract key business insights. It covers end-to-end analysis — from total orders and revenue calculation to category-wise performance and time-based trends. Each query is designed to answer a specific analytical question, such as identifying top-selling pizza types, highest revenue contributors, order distribution by time, category performance, and cumulative revenue growth. Advanced SQL functions like joins, grouping, window functions, ranking, and aggregation are used to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
